# suggestions for improvments to the musit dump 
Lacking some mandatory fields in the dump, also some fields does not comply with GBIF standards. 

So far noted: 
* countryCode (required field)
* sex (should follow controlled vocabulary, i.e. male, female, unknown...). 
* taxonRank (missing)
* higher taxa information (kingdom, order etc...)
